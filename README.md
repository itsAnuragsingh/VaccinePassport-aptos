BlockVax: Decentralized Vaccine Passport on Aptos
Project Description
BlockVax is a blockchain-based vaccine passport system built on the Aptos network. This smart contract solution allows for the secure, transparent, and privacy-preserving management of vaccination records. Using Move language, BlockVax creates a tamper-proof system where users own their vaccination data while authorized healthcare providers can verify and update records.

The core smart contract enables:

Creation of personal vaccination records
Addition and verification of individual vaccine statuses
Decentralized management of health credentials
Simplified verification process for authorities
Project Vision
In a world where health verification has become increasingly important, BlockVax aims to revolutionize how vaccination records are managed and verified. Our vision is to create a universal, user-controlled system that:

Empowers individuals by giving them ownership and control over their health records
Eliminates fraud through blockchain's immutable record-keeping
Enhances privacy by revealing only necessary information during verification
Bridges borders by creating a globally recognized vaccination credential system
Simplifies compliance for businesses, events, and travel requirements
BlockVax represents the future of digital health credentialsâ€”where verification is instant, forgery is impossible, and individuals maintain sovereignty over their personal health data.

This project is currently in development phase. The smart contract serves as a foundational prototype for the BlockVax ecosystem.
